    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These easy strawberry brownies are made with strawberry cake mix, and iced with a fresh strawberry glaze.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) box strawberry cake mix</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>3 strawberries, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

    </ul>>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <l1>Step 2
            Mix cake mix, melted butter, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined. Spread mixture into an even layer in the prepared baking dish.
        </l1>
        <l1>Step 3
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow brownies to cool in the pan for about 20 minutes.
        </l1>
        <l1>Step 4
            Meanwhile, puree strawberries and remaining teaspoon of vanilla extract in a food processor or with an immersion blender until smooth.
        </l1>
        <l1>Step 5
            Stir strawberry mixture into confectionerâ€™s sugar until smooth, adding extra sugar as necessary to reach the consistency of a glaze. Add salt and stir. 
        </l1>
        <l1>Step 6
            Spread strawberry glaze evenly over the cooled brownies and let stand until completely cooled.  Cut into 12 squares, or refrigerate until ready to serve.
